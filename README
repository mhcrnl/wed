This is the source code for the wed (Windows like EDitor) text editor.
The intention of the wed project is to create a simple terminal text editor
with windows like key bindings.

At this first stage wed can only display a single file or an empty buffer. It doesn't have
any editing functionality yet. This will be added subsequently.
